This is a fork/update of the lpsolve wrapper by Juergen Ebert, mavenizing etc.

See README.html for documentation, such that it is.

This isn't a terribly user-friendly API. I'm working on this to use
it in Breeze (and further downstream...), and I'm not terribly interested
in making it more pleasant to use.
